# _SupelTex_ - a texture generator

_SupelTex_ is ultra-high resolution texture generator based on super ellipses. _SupelTex_ can generate icons, logos and game assets. A texture is generated from a JSON parameter file with _supels_ and _patches_ defintions. A _supel_ is a super ellipse defined over the two-dimensional OpenGL logical space. A _patch_ is a solid-coloured super-ellipse projected onto a strip defined by two _supels_.

For usage of _SupelTex_, see `python3 supeltex.py --help`. For an example parameters defintion, see `parameters.json`.
